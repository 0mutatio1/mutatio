# (Almost) Everything in java is an object

## Why Almost

## How to manipulate object
you use reference to manupulate objects.
```java
String a;
```

## How to create object
you use `new` to create object in heap.
```java
String a = new String("a");
```

## Object
![object](./object.png)
every class is directry or indirectry derived from the `Object` class.
So, in java everty object have the same method inheriated from `Object`.

## Class
class (type) create our user-defined class.
In java, `Class` contains too many information.
for example, you have an `Object` but how can you know 
what kind of `Class(type)` it is ? you use `Class`.

## Code Reusing

### Composition (has-a)

### Inheritance (is-a)
