# Object Oriented Programming

We abstract what we are dealing with to `object`.

- Everything is an object
- A program is a bunch of objects telling each other
what to do by sending messages
- Each object has its own memory made up of other objects
- Every object has a type
- All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages

## Object
An object has state, behavior and identity
- state
- behavior
- identity

## Abstraction
Every thing about computer is based upon abstraction which make sense to
our human's brain.
Every Programming language make their own abstraction.
Machine code -- abstraction --> Assemble language -- abstraction --> high level programming language

With programming language, we model the problem we're trying to solve to program.

## Encapsulation
Access control
encapsulation prevent you from anything evil.
so it will protect our `object` from outside world.

in java there are `access specifiers(modifiers)`
- package default private
- public
- private
- protected

## inheritance
- Code Reuse
- Singly rooted
We can use existing class and make some modifications rather create a brand new 
class.
But once we change the `base class(superclass)`, the `derived class(subclass)` will
be changed too.

## polymorphism
- late binding
- java use dynamic binding 
- upcasting
