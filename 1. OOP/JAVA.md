# JAVA

we create new data types in java, which use
 `class(type)` to define a type in java.

Java has built-in data-types but we are not 
restrict to thoes types, we can define out own
types with `class` to model to concrete problems
and to extend the language.

The `type` determine what the object can do and 
can not do, the `type` has a `interface` for all
derived objects.
