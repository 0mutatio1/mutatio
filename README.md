## About Java
Programming language is just a tool.
So learning the programming language and know what it can do and what is
can not do is another thing.
As for me, Java is kind of complex but simple.

## Purpose
We should learn the basic concepts behind the knowledge.
Then we learn how it is implemented with differences.
Then we should know how to use it properly.

I will display the java based on books and extend these
books to make it make sense to me.
